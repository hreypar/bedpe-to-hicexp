# bedpe-to-hicexp #

Import bedpe matrices of any resolution into R and generate a hicexp object

## About ##

This module requires that you place all the bedpe matrices (in `Rds` format) that will become a single `hicexp` object under the same directory.
It is assumed by the module's scripts that the bedpe files are named `*-rep[0-9]_[0-9].bedpe.Rds`
